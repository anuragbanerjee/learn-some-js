<h2>Lesson 3</h2>
<p>
In this lesson, we're going to learn AJAX. AJAX means "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML," and it's really a web standard popularized by Google. It allows you to get data and send data on a website without refreshing the entire page all over again. You can just get and send the data you need as you need it.
<br>
<br>
There's a security issue if you just open the HTML file and it tries to run AJAX, so we need to spin up a basic local server. Go to where this repo is and run:
<pre><code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code></pre>
Now in a browser, you can see the website at <a href="http://localhost:8000">localhost:8000</a>.
<br>
<br>
The default syntax is <pre><code>$.ajax({
  url: "http://...",
  method: "GET",
  success: function (data) {
    // do something with data
  }
});</code></pre>
