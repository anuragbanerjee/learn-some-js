# Lesson 0: Getting Setup

Dude, this part sucks. After people get things set up, they never think about it. You're definitely going to not think about this again once it's done. Anyway, let's do this, and we'll get to the actually cool stuff.

## Mac OS

1. At the top right of your computer, click on the search icon/magnifying glass.
2. Type in `Terminal` and press enter.
3. Copy and paste this into the terminal `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` and press enter. Enter your password if necessary to install.
4. Enter in `brew install node`. May take a while.
