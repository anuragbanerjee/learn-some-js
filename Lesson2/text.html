<h2>Lesson 2</h2>
<p>
Let's take what we learned from Lesson 1 and apply it to some front-end stuff. Here, we're going to make a small search box. The goal is to make it with the following requirements in mind:
  <ul>
    <li>Type some query in the text field, hit enter.
    <li>Look up if query is in your available data.</li>
    <li>If it is, show the first picture associated to it.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, give an alert saying nothing was found.</li>
  </ul>

Give it a try. Enter AJ or Paul in the text field and press enter. You should get a picture of some cool dudes.
